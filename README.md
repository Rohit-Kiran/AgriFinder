# AgriFinder
Agrifinder is a machine learning project designed to help farmers determine the best crops to grow in a particular soil type based on its nutrient content and geographical location. The system takes in the input of the soil's nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) values, along with the temperature, humidity percentage, Ph, Rainfall in mm and state information, and uses this data to provide the most suitable crop for the given soil.

The Agrifinder system is built on a machine learning algorithm that analyses the input data to determine the soil type and the crop that would perform best in that soil. This algorithm is trained using a large dataset of soil and crop information, which allows it to accurately predict the most suitable crops for a given soil type.

Once the Agrifinder system has analysed the input data, it provides the user with a list of suitable crops for the soil type. This information can help farmers to make informed decisions about which crops to plant, thereby increasing their yield and profitability.

In summary, the Agrifinder system is a powerful tool for farmers, allowing them to make informed decisions about which crops to plant in a particular soil type. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this system is able to provide accurate and timely information that can help farmers to improve their crop yields and profitability.
